# pascal-interpreter

Pascal interpreter and C code generator written in Python. 

Current version contains finished Lexer (lexical analyzer), Parser (syntax analyzer) and Grapher (AST generator) for the Pascal programming language.
Future versions will include a Pascal Interpreter and a C code generator.

Grapher is written using the Visitor pattern.

It's purpose will be to translate Pascal to C code, but it's modular components can easily be reused for different projects.
